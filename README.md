## 🚀 Introduction
`ProxyPass` is a MITM proxy for `Minecraft: Bedrock Edition` that sits between an unmodified vanilla client and server.
It helps protocol developers inspect, forward, and optionally modify packets in real time, making protocol debugging and vanilla behavior analysis much easier.

## 📝 Notes
`ProxyPass` requires the backend server to run with online mode disabled (`online-mode=false`).
With online mode disabled, the server does not verify client identity, so `ProxyPass` can relay traffic between the client and server.

If online mode is enabled, the server will reject `ProxyPass` because it cannot provide valid authentication.
Make sure your server is configured correctly before testing.
